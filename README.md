This repository contains an end-to-end image captioning and query response system using **YOLOv5** for object detection, **BLIP** for image captioning, and **BERT** for query understanding and response generation. The system can detect objects in an image, generate descriptive captions, and respond to natural language queries about the image.

## Introduction

This project is designed to provide an interactive image captioning and query response system:
- **YOLOv5** detects objects in the image.
- **BLIP** generates a natural language caption describing the scene.
- **BERT** handles user queries related to the caption and generates responses based on the caption.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Input**: An image.
2. **Object Detection**: YOLOv5 detects objects like `["person", "car", "dog"]`.
3. **Caption Generation**: BLIP generates a caption such as: *"A person is standing next to a car while a dog is sitting in the back seat."*
4. **Query Handling**: BERT processes user queries like "What is the horse doing?" and responds with: *"running."*

## Features
